        <h4>Recipe instructions (taken from the book)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.AND Season the pounded pork chops with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Dust with a light, even coating of flour.</li>
           <li>In one shallow bowl, beat 1 of the eggs. Put the panko into another shallow bowl.</li>
           <li>Add a thin, even layer of oil to a cast-iron pan or skillet over medium heat. The oil is ready when you drop a panko breadcrumb into it and it sizzles.</li>
          <li>Dip the flour-dusted pork into the egg to coat both sides.</li>
         <li>Transfer the pork to the panko and press it evenly into the meat to get a good coating.</li> 
         <li>Carefully lay the pork chops in the hot oil and cook for 5 to 6 minutes on one side, until golden brown.</li>
          <li>Flip and cook the other side for another 5 to 6 minutes, or until browned, crispy, and cooked through.</li>
          <li>Drain on a plate lined with a paper towel.</li>
          <li>Slice your tonkatsu into pieces.</li>
          <li>Put the dashi soup stock in a pan and heat on medium heat.</li>
          <li>Add the soy sauce, mirin, and sugar to the soup and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat.</li>
           <li>To cook 1 serving of katsudon, put 1/4 of the soup and 1/4 of the sliced onion in a small skillet. Simmer for a few minutes on medium heat.</li>
          <li>Add 1 serving of tonkatsu pieces (half of 1 pork cutlet) to the pan and simmer on low heat for a few minutes.</li>
          <li>Beat another one of the eggs in a bowl. Bring the soup to a boil and pour the egg over the tonkatsu and onion.</li>
           <li>Turn the heat down to low and cover with a lid. Cook until the egg has set and remove it from the heat. The egg should be cooked through.</li>
          <li>Serve by placing 1 serving of steamed rice in a large rice bowl. Top with the simmered tonkatsu on top of the rice. Repeat to make 3 more servings.</li>
